## Stake FitFi for Drop Tickets

In this phase you **stake** your FitFi tokens to earn **Drop Tickets** (DT).  
For every 100 FitFi staked you get 1 DT each day, until the snapshot is done.

### How To Stake
1. Install MetaMask (app or browser extension)
2. Create a new Account to use with `step.app` (or use an existing one, but I preffer to limit the use of an address)
3. Add the `Avalanche Network` and switch to it
4. [Import](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Se1FHvcihiI) the `FitFi` token `0x714f020c54cc9d104b6f4f6998c63ce2a31d1888` into MetaMask
5. Buy and/or transfer `AVAX` to your MetaMask Account address (from Binance, Coinbase, FTX, Crypto.com, etc)
  * send first just `0.1 AVAX` to validate the flow
  * once you've got them in your MetaMask wallet, you can transfer the rest
6. Convert from `AVAX` to `FitFi` using the MetaMask `Swap` feature
7. Connect your MetaMask to https://staking.step.app/ and stake your FitFi
8. Sit back and wait, you're done for now !
